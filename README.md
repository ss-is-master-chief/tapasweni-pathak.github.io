  * While working for these three Fiori application also enhanced core methods, API; mainly backend, worked on customer incidents.

* Interim Engineering Intern @Qualcomm Inc.
  * Created WCDMA Enhanced Uplink Timing Log Packet
  
    In EUL, logging data through F3 messages, though convenient, draws a considerable percentage of CPU MIPS. This eats into the MIPS       available for EUL data-processing and thus adversely affects the throughput. Therefore, a convenient and quick means of logging the     various events and messages without the added overhead of F3 processing in diag was needed. Developed a packet which logs the timing 
    of Enhanced Up link profiled data path handlers. The packet is submitted to DIAG when the EUL data path handler end time is reached. 
    Each log packet will have a fixed number of samples specified in the log packet header. This packet is delivered every 200 ms or 
    upon reconfiguration or active set update. We will have a sample for this packet every TTI. For 10 ms TTI and for 2 ms TTI, it will 
    contain 40 samples.

* IIT Delhi Summer Intern
  * Created [WISEKAR](http://sensecan.org/wisekar/index.php/main) Optimal Travel Route Java Swing Application
    For computing Optimal Travel Route between node locations in WISEKAR. Start and end time stamps on the app are used to retrieve 
    location information about nodes from Wisekar. Brute Force and Simulated Annealing (with a lower time complexity) are used to      
    compute solution to the NP-Hard Travelling Salesman Problem in order to find optimal and near Optimal Travel Route respectively with 
    [Prof. Subrat Kar](http://web.iitd.ac.in/~subrat/) and [Dr. Sanat Sarangi](https://sites.google.com/site/sanatsarangi/).
